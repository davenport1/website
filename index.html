            <p1>        I am currently a computer science student attending 
            De Anza College in Cupertino, CA. Ultimately my 
            interests are leading me towards game and software design.
            I served for four years in the Marine Corps infantry 
            before separating in 2019 to pursue my goals in the 
            technology industry. Other than my passion for 
            computers and technology, I greatly enjoy the outdoors;
            backpacking and camping. When I can't make it outside, 
            I love to play music with my guitar.
